This is a test of extracting the Force Directed Graph flash component from the code that drives http://emmetlabs.com/ ( see https://github.com/verbad/EmmetLabs ).  

A live example of the running code can be seen (as of this writing) at: http://fdg-production.heroku.com/ 
Note that this uses static XML to generate the Force Directed Graph -- which is downloaded from 
http://emmetlabs.com/network/Martin-Luther_417.xml
